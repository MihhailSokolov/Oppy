Step 1: Develop a goal

These are some of my personal strengths:
- I have a strong motivation which allows me to work very hard voor extended periods of time when I have to. 
For example when I realize a haven't done enough for a test I can easily work through the night untill I get everything done.
For the team this means that when I say I'm getting something done, I get it done.

- I take initiative, for example I do not wait for other people to ask me to do something before I do it.
For the team this means, I won't sit around doing nothing for extended periods of time.

These are some of my personal weaknesses:
- I ask a lot of questions even about little things. I do this because I want to make sure I am doing things the right way.
This can result in me becomming a little anoying to my teammates.

- I do get distracted easily when I get stuck somewhere. This happens a lot when learning for test but I always get trough it.
In the team this may result in me working at a less than optimal speed.

Step 2: Create a plan to achieve your goal

My goal for this project is to improve my communication skills, and become good enough at java to work on a project on my own.
I haven not continued developing my java skills after OOP, buy I am eager to learn. I plan to start improving my communication skills by keeping everyone updated on what I am doing.
And helping others as much as possible. 
I plan to start improving my java skills by coding as much as possible and asking my teammates when I can not find answers on google.
What I can do right now is make sure i meet everyone and start refresh my memory about java.
