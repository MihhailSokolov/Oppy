self dev:
Step 1: Develop a goal

These are some of my personal strengths:
- I have a strong motivation which allows me to work very hard voor extended periods of time when I have to. 
For example when I realize a haven't done enough for a test I can easily work through the night untill I get everything done.
For the team this means that when I say I'm getting something done, I get it done.

- I take initiative, for example I do not wait for other people to ask me to do something before I do it.
For the team this means, I won't sit around doing nothing for extended periods of time.

These are some of my personal weaknesses:
- I ask a lot of questions even about little things. I do this because I want to make sure I am doing things the right way.
This can result in me becomming a little anoying to my teammates.

- I do get distracted easily when I get stuck somewhere. This happens a lot when learning for test but I always get trough it.
In the team this may result in me working at a less than optimal speed.

Step 2: Create a plan to achieve your goal

My goal for this project is to improve my communication skills, and become good enough at java to work on a project on my own.
I haven not continued developing my java skills after OOP, buy I am eager to learn. I plan to start improving my communication skills by keeping everyone updated on what I am doing.
And helping others as much as possible. 
I plan to start improving my java skills by coding as much as possible and asking my teammates when I can not find answers on google.
What I can do right now is make sure i meet everyone and start refresh my memory about java.

Strong points:
-I can work many hours in a day till late in the night. For example I worked until 04:30 when finishing the project for the web part of web- and database. If there's a deadline I can do some stuff till late at night if needed.
-I have my stuff complete when we agreed. I used to work manny times in the night on high school to reach deadlines which I discussed with teammates. this show in the team (hopefully) by finishing my work in time.

Weak points:
-I sometimes have tunnel vision. Like when I try to hardcode something you can easily do with a loop. Can show when I focus too much on one particular way of solving a problem while negating an easier one. 
-I can get distracted while working with a group. Like hired a room at ewi to study for the ADS exame, but we just ended up joking around and not doing anything productive. Can show by not being as productive when i知 with the group as when i知 working alone.

I want to learn how to work together with a group while developing a project. This is important to me because I have to do this when I get a job later.
I知 not working at that goal jet. I知 gonna start doing that with this project.
To reach this goal I知 gonna do this project. My first step is starting making a planning with this group. 
My teammates can help me with this by making their part of the project.

Personal Development Plan:
I consider my strong points to be that I am hard-working and quick-learning. So, I can quite quickly learn new things. My weak point, I think, is the lack of experience of working in team. My second weak point is that I am not good in testing. I would really like to improve that because it will be essential in the future.
My main goal would be to get a high grade for this course (at least 8), but I also would like to obtain more experience in working in team with other programmers. Because later, when working for some company, this experience will most likely be crucial. Currently, I am overcoming the dislike for asking for help and becoming more open. Now I just want to get experience in working in team.
To achieve my goal, I reckon, I just need to work in team, complete my tasks in time and take part in discussions and planning. And I will certainly do my best to achieve all my goals.
