Personal Development Plan

Two of my strong points are:
1. I'm good at git this is useful to fix the problems which we
are surely going to have.
2. I like explaining stuff to help get people further. This is obviously
useful.

Two of my weaker points are:
1. I can be rather bossy, and I need to become more open to other people's
ideas
2. I'm bad at testing, just incredibly bad. I hope I can get some
help from one of the team members on this front.


G
I hope to learn how to test in a more efficient and quick manner. Also
I want to lose some bad habits, the best way to achieve both of these
goals is, using my team well by making merge requests often, so my code
gets reviewed often and I get feedback often.

I would like to get better at testing because it has always been my
weakness. Bad habits cause me to lose a lot of time whilst working
so it would be great to become a bit faster.

I will have achieved my goal of improving my testing abilities when
I no longer find myself struggling to write tests in a way that is
so bad in comparison to just writing code.
I will have achieved my goal of losing bad habits when I find my speed
significantly increase.

R
The best way of losing bad habits is of course doing the right alternative
and the best way of doing this is maintaining structure, this means that
at first I will probably lose efficiency rather than gain it but in the end
it should be worth it.

Testing is something I have mostly ignored but I understand it all in theory
so I think I'm going to start by reading up on some good practices.

O
There are many options to improve both my testing capabilities and my coding
habits, but I think in the spirit of this project I'm going to try to use the
team as much as possible. The biggest thing stopping me from achieving my goals
is being distracted.

W
To reach my goals I am going to do two things:
1. try to do as much testing as possible.
2. work structured all the time.

I am going to start work on this monday the 18th.

self dev:
Step 1: Develop a goal

These are some of my personal strengths:
- I have a strong motivation which allows me to work very hard voor extended periods of time when I have to.
For example when I realize a haven't done enough for a test I can easily work through the night untill I get everything done.
For the team this means that when I say I'm getting something done, I get it done.

- I take initiative, for example I do not wait for other people to ask me to do something before I do it.
For the team this means, I won't sit around doing nothing for extended periods of time.

These are some of my personal weaknesses:
- I ask a lot of questions even about little things. I do this because I want to make sure I am doing things the right way.
This can result in me becomming a little anoying to my teammates.

- I do get distracted easily when I get stuck somewhere. This happens a lot when learning for test but I always get trough it.
In the team this may result in me working at a less than optimal speed.

Step 2: Create a plan to achieve your goal

My goal for this project is to improve my communication skills, and become good enough at java to work on a project on my own.
I haven not continued developing my java skills after OOP, buy I am eager to learn. I plan to start improving my communication skills by keeping everyone updated on what I am doing.
And helping others as much as possible.
I plan to start improving my java skills by coding as much as possible and asking my teammates when I can not find answers on google.
What I can do right now is make sure i meet everyone and start refresh my memory about java.

Strong points:
-I can work many hours in a day till late in the night. For example I worked until 04:30 when finishing the project for the web part of web- and database. If there's a deadline I can do some stuff till late at night if needed.
-I have my stuff complete when we agreed. I used to work manny times in the night on high school to reach deadlines which I discussed with teammates. this show in the team (hopefully) by finishing my work in time.

Weak points:
-I sometimes have tunnel vision. Like when I try to hardcode something you can easily do with a loop. Can show when I focus too much on one particular way of solving a problem while negating an easier one. 
-I can get distracted while working with a group. Like hired a room at ewi to study for the ADS exame, but we just ended up joking around and not doing anything productive. Can show by not being as productive when i’m with the group as when i’m working alone.

I want to learn how to work together with a group while developing a project. This is important to me because I have to do this when I get a job later.
I’m not working at that goal jet. I’m gonna start doing that with this project.
To reach this goal I’m gonna do this project. My first step is starting making a planning with this group. 
My teammates can help me with this by making their part of the project.

Strong points:
-- Local programming
-- Can explain known concepts well

Weak points:
-- Sometimes work alone for too long
Personally I'd like to learn more about:

G - Goal
- Downloading/computing using a web-api
- Client server interactions

It's important to me because it's something that I haven't worked with before and I'd like to learn more about. I believe when we have succesfully deployed our application I will have at the very least a basic grasp of the aforementioned subjects.
R - Reality
- Not actively working on it (yet)
O - Options
- Study the required/appropriate material every day
W - Will
- Do my best to keep up with the required material
- Lab days and in between those days if time permits

Mihhail netid: msokolov
Personal Development Plan:
I consider my strong points to be that I am hard-working and quick-learning. So, I can quite quickly learn new things. My weak point, I think, is the lack of experience of working in team. My second weak point is that I am not good in testing. I would really like to improve that because it will be essential in the future.
My main goal would be to get a high grade for this course (at least 8), but I also would like to obtain more experience in working in team with other programmers. Because later, when working for some company, this experience will most likely be crucial. Currently, I am overcoming the dislike for asking for help and becoming more open. Now I just want to get experience in working in team.
To achieve my goal, I reckon, I just need to work in team, complete my tasks in time and take part in discussions and planning. And I will certainly do my best to achieve all my goals.

Step 1
Stronger points:
Responsibility - I believe I complete my tasks in time. It might take me some time to get started, but I feel like I finish most of my tasks before the deadline.
“A team player” - I always try to be positive. I enjoy helping out my team members if I can and have the required knowledge. 

Weaker points:
Problem solving - sometimes when I get confused with certain tasks, I tend to get stuck and not make much progression by searching for solutions in wrong places.
Experience in the field of programming - I am relatively new to programming(no previous experience before OOP course). This might lead to me looking for some advice from my fellow group members.

Step 2
G - Goal
Improving my programming skills/mastering the basics - I feel this is the basis of creating something. I believe I have achieved this goal by the end of our project.
R - Reality
	I feel like recently I haven’t put much focus on improving my programming skills. I should start looking for ways to implement programming in my daily life and create simple projects for practice. 
	I think I should start looking for different languages for programming and find something that suits me the most.
O - Options
	There seems to be a lot of options to achieve my goal, since the internet is full of information and I also have my teammates to learn from. 
	I would like to learn from my team members, as this would also complement my team-work skills. I think the only thing holding me back could be my own motivation.
W - Will
	I am going to start creating small projects and will try to perfect them/make them as efficient as possible(I was thinking about creating a program to create flashcards for learning a language). 
	I feel like my teammates could help me notice some inefficenies inside my code and guide me to a better solution.
