Otni and markus missing (intier client side).
chairman is Hugo
Notetaker Duyemo
Client Side didn�t respond if they were done friday

Goals of last week:
-login en register page UI and server side done
-server and database running on heroku
-Client Side is missing at this point


Benjamin made login page, made standard for how the code of pages should look like and fought with intellij

Sam set up the server, started on mongoDB and wrote a few tests.

Mihhail provided standard for between client and serverside , made mapping , made class for storing methods, created mongoDB on heroku and got the server side running.

Duyemo made registerpage., provided switching between scenes and fought with gitlab and inteliJ.

Hugo made class for users, made tests for it and treding a bit behind other server side guys due to personal issues.

Also everyone did some code revieuwing
Try to really get  that 14-15 hours of work in each week. Pull more work if it you don�t haven�t spend enough time

Change teams because same teams every week doesn�t create a good teamwork and other problems, for example the missing clientside. always keep one guy with experience in all teams at each time

teams and tasks for this week:
-UI Duyemo: Mainpage, and add action page
-server Mihhail: being able to store and update points
-client Hugo Benjamin Sam: client login and register, and if that�s done then for main page and add action, starting with vegaterian 
-Both server and client: try to get test and branch coverage up. jcoco.

Markus and Otni will test the client side and if they have time left and need to hit the 14houres they can make the UI a bit more fancy

next meeting: We don�t really know how to test our client side due to it being integrated with the UI.
