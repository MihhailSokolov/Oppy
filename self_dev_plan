Personally I'd like to learn more about:

G - Goal
- Downloading/computing using a web-api
- Client server interactions

It's important to me because it's something that I haven't worked with before and I'd like to learn more about. I believe when we have succesfully deployed our application I will have at the very least a basic grasp of the aforementioned subjects.
================================================================
R - Reality
- Not actively working on it (yet)

================================================================
O - Options
- Study the required/appropriate material every day
================================================================
W - Will
- Do my best to keep up with the required material
- Lab days and in between those days if time permits
